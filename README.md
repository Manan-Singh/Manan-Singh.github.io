Hi, my name is Manan Singh. I'm a backend software engineer working in the greater New York / New Jersey area. 

I have ~4.5 years of industry experience in building and maintaining core back-end systems. In my time, I've worked on products ranging from low-latency, request-for-quote trading applications to highly available and distributed tax calculation platforms.
