# Welcome to `#MANANDEV`

Hi, my name is Manan Singh. I'm a backend developer working in the greater New York / New Jersey area. 

I have ~4.5 years of professional industry experience building and maintaining core back-end technology systems. In my time, I've worked on products ranging from low-latency, request-for-quote trading applications to highly available and distributed tax calculation platforms.
