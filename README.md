# Welcome!
## Who Am I?

Hi, I'm Manan. I'm a backend software engineer working in the greater New York / New Jersey area. 

I have ~6 years of industry experience in building and maintaining core back-end systems. In my time, I've worked on products ranging from low-latency trading applications, highly critical tax calculation platforms, and even ad serving stack migrations.

If you would like to contact me for professional or personal opportunities, please send an email over to `manan@manandev.com`!
