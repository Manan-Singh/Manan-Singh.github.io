                        <p>Hi, and welcome to the webpage of Manan Singh! I am currently a college student who plans on becoming a full
                        stack developer. On this page you'll find information on who I am and what I do. If you have any questions 
                        feel free to contact me using the contact information below.</p>

                    <h2 class = "wow slideInRight">Schooling</h2>
                    <div class = "schooling">
                        <p>In 2014, I graduated Deer Park High School in Suffolk County New York. I currently attend Stony Brook University
                        and am pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science. My expected graduation date is in May of 2018.</p>

                    <div class = "hobbies">
                        <p>I have a variety of hobbies that I like to keep up with. Sometimes I'm sketching. Sometimes I'm playing badminton.
                        However I suppose my favorite hobbies include playing strategy games. I love chess, and recently I've also been 
                        playing a lot of go/baduk. Of course video games are another favorite of mine, especially puzzle games.</p>

                    click the link and it'll take you to my github page. Here you'll find everything from course schedulers to

                    <p>My LinkedIn profile is still somewhat in its infant stages however if you would like to view it I have included
                    a link. It functions as my online resume however I may or may not change this later and simply include a link to 
                    a public google docs link instead. </p>
